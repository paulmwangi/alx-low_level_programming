0-malloc_checked.c: This program features a function that allocates memory using malloc. The function's prototype is void *malloc_checked(unsigned int b), and it returns a pointer to the allocated memory. In the event that malloc fails, the malloc_checked function ensures normal process termination with a status value of 98.

1-string_nconcat.c: In this code, a function is provided for concatenating two strings. The function's prototype is char *string_nconcat(char *s1, char *s2, unsigned int n). It returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains s1, followed by the first n bytes of s2, and is null-terminated. If the function fails, it returns NULL. If n is greater or equal to the length of s2, it uses the entire string s2. If NULL is passed, it treats it as an empty string.

2-calloc.c: This code introduces a function for allocating memory for an array using malloc. The function's prototype is void *_calloc(unsigned int nmemb, unsigned int size). The _calloc function allocates memory for an array of nmemb elements, each of size size bytes, and returns a pointer to the allocated memory. The allocated memory is initialized to zero. If either nmemb or size is 0, the function returns NULL. If malloc fails, it also returns NULL. Note that the standard library provides a different function called calloc.

3-array_range.c: In this code, a function creates an array of integers. The function's prototype is int *array_range(int min, int max). The array it creates contains all values from min (inclusive) to max (inclusive), ordered from min to max. It returns a pointer to the newly created array. If min is greater than max, it returns NULL. If malloc fails, it also returns NULL.

100-realloc.c: This code features a function for reallocating a memory block using malloc and free. The function's prototype is void *_realloc(void *ptr, unsigned int old_size, unsigned int new_size). The ptr parameter is a pointer to memory previously allocated with a call to malloc with size old_size. The function reallocates memory to the size of new_size in bytes. The function copies the contents from the old memory block to the newly allocated space within the range from the start of ptr up to the minimum of the old and new sizes. If new_size is greater than old_size, the added memory is not initialized. If new_size is equal to old_size, no action is taken, and the function returns ptr. If ptr is NULL, the call is equivalent to malloc(new_size), regardless of the values of old_size and new_size. If new_size is equal to zero and ptr is not NULL, the call is equivalent to free(ptr) and returns NULL. The code ensures that ptr is freed when appropriate. It's worth noting that the standard library provides a different function called realloc.

101-mul.c: This program performs the multiplication of two positive numbers. To use it, run mul num1 num2, where num1 and num2 are passed in base 10. The program will print the result, followed by a new line. In the case of an incorrect number of arguments, the program prints "Error," followed by a new line, and exits with a status of 98. Both num1 and num2 should only consist of digits. If they don't, the program again prints "Error," followed by a new line, and exits with a status of 98. It's permissible to use more than 5 functions in the program, and the bc utility can be used to validate the results.
