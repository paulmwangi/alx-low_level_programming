# Project: Search Algorithms

## Resources
- [Search algorithm](https://realpython.com/python-keyboard-input/)
- [Space complexity (1)](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_user_input.asp)
- [Search Algorithms video playlist](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/User_input_methods)

## Learning Objectives
After completing this project, you should be able to explain the following without needing to search online:
- **General Concepts**:
  - What a search algorithm is
  - The differences between linear and binary search
  - The most suitable search algorithm based on various needs

## Requirements
- **Editors**: vi, vim, emacs
- **Compilation**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- **File Endings**: All files must end with a new line
- **README**: A README.md file is mandatory at the root of the project folder
- **Coding Style**: Betty style, checked with betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- **Variables**: No global variables allowed
- **Function Limit**: No more than 5 functions per file
- **Standard Library**: Only the printf function is allowed. Calls to functions like strdup, malloc, etc., are forbidden.
- **Testing**: You can test your functions with main.c files, but they are not required for submission.
- **Header File**: All function prototypes must be in a header file called search_algos.h, which must be include guarded.

## More Info
- Big O notations must be written in the following format:
  - O(1)
  - O(n)
  - O(n!)
  - n*m -> O(nm)
  - n square -> O(n^2)
  - sqrt n -> O(sqrt(n))
  - log(n) -> O(log(n))
  - n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))
